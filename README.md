Step 4: Stop Capturing
Wait for 1 minute, then click the red square in Wireshark to stop the capture.

Step 5: Filter Packets
You'll see many packets; to filter them, type http, dns, or tcp in the search bar and press Enter to view specific traffic types.

Step 7: Save the Capture File
Go to File > Save As, name the file (ex: elevate), and save itâ€”this creates your .pcap capture file.
